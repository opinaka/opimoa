# How We Took Feedback Into Account

When evaluating the pull request, we tested the code changes to ensure that the functionality he added integrated well with our code. We encountered some issues and additional bugs in the code based on the new additions. We experienced difficulty when debugging the new code since the changes in the pull request involved new ways of testing. 

Miles' pull request implemented a Flask server that connected the Python code to the HTML. This added the functionality of running Python code directly inside the Blockly window, instead of having to copy and paste the generated code into Google Colab. We encountered various problems when testing this new code. The generated code did not run successfully in the Blockly code window and we were not able to diagnose the errors that came up since there was limited documentation and error tracing in the Python files provided. The pull request also added a Dockerfile that allowed us to create a blocklyml docker image, and start the flask server whenever we created a Docker container from this image. This implementation also led to various issues when we tried to make changes to the files in order to fix the new bugs. We had to rebuild the image and re-instantiate the Docker container each time we wanted to make a change to the code. After going through this process, we determined that the addition of a Docker image does not align with our project's goals. We wanted to make machine learning accessible to all, and the additional system requirements and knowledge that come with a Docker implementation may limit those who will be able to utilize our project.

One issue that was raised that was not fixed in the pull request was a bug in our code where we had an extra parenthesis on the outside of our import statements when using the **'Print Data'** block. We were able to fix this issue by changing the code for the print data block to mimic that of other blocks that previously had the same issue. This change is now fixed and pushed to our repository.
