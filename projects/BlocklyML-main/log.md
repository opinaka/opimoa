# How we divided up work

Since we are using Blockly for this project, we decided to distribute a section of blocks to each person. People in the group who are most familiar with Machine Learning concepts were assigned the more complicated blocks to implement.

For Milestone 1, Chris completed the blocks for the "Data Visualization" section. Minna completed the blocks for "Clean Data" section. Evelyn completed the blocks for the "Model Selection," "Model Training," and "Model Evaluation" sections. Everyone contributed to the README.md.

# Our use of AI 

We mainly used AI to help debug errors that we weren't able to understand. When creating and putting blocks together, we encountered issues that concerned our blocks' input and output data types. AI was able to help identify aspects of our code that were causing these linking issues. We also used AI to verify if the generated Python code is correct and makes sense in the context of Machine Learning.
