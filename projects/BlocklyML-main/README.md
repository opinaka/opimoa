## Motivation and Description
We were inspired to design this project based on our interest in machine learning. Since each group member has varying experience with the topic, we thought this would be a great learning experience no matter our current knowledge level. As of now, machine learning is an extremely sought out topic, so creating a Blockly language that assists the user through the typical scikit-learn workflow to train a model is an effective learning entry point for those who are new to the topic.

This project provides an introduction for users new to machine learning by guiding them through the traditional steps for building a machine learning model in an intuitive, block-based interface such as Blockly. Users will be able to input their own datasets, choose between various options for data cleaning and preprocessing, split data into train and test sets, choose the best features for prediction, decide among various machine learning models, tune the hyperparameters of the selected model, and evaluate the modelâ€™s performance. The goal of BlocklyML is to create an interface that streamlines the process of machine learning design in a beginner-friendly way. 

## Parsing, Interpretation, and Compilation

In our BlocklyML educational tool, we will integrate the fundamental concepts of parsing, interpretation, and compilation, providing a way for users to practice machine learning concepts through Blockly-based visual programming. With the implementation of parsing, our tool will allow users to input data in the form of CSV files. Our tool will then extract and convert the data into structured representations that can be fed into machine learning models. This process facilitates efficient data cleaning and transformation. Our tool will then help users comprehend their data by implementing interpretation. Through user-friendly Blockly-based visual programming, we enable users to interpret data characteristics, relationships, and potential features, providing further insight into their datasets. Users will be able to work with visual representations of data pipelines, model architectures, and training processes, offering a more intuitive understanding of machine learning concepts.

Additionally, compilation principles are applied when users construct machine learning models using our tool. The visual blocks and connections created by users are translated by our tool into executable machine learning code. This compilation process ensures that the models built by users are both accurate and efficient. By integrating these concepts into our machine learning educational tool, we allow users to not only apply machine learning techniques but also gain valuable insights into the underlying processes of parsing, interpretation, and compilation using visual code blocks, enhancing their overall data science and machine learning proficiency.
