    Visual Blocks for ML is a Google visual programming framework that lets you create ML pipelines in a no-code graph editor. You – and your users – can quickly prototype workflows by connecting drag-and-drop ML components, including models, user inputs, processors, and visualizations.

What are we doing? Why?<br>
Learning machine learning is hard. We're trying to fix that.

Machine learning is playing an increasingly important role in our society, but very few people understand it. Even to programmers, it's portrayed as this super complicated wizardry that you need to have gone to graduate school to understand. However, we think that machine learning doesn't have to be incredibly complicated, and that it can be taught to anyone, even non-programmers.

Right now, most machine learning tutorials/frameworks use languages like Python (along with many libraries) and assume coding experience, but this discourages people who don't have these prerequisites. ML concepts don't have a fundamental link with text based languages, so we created a system that doesn't pretend they do.

Kobra is a block-based visual programming language (like Scratch) designed to help people learn machine learning. Our editor, Kobra Studio, is tailored to building machine learning applications, featuring built-in data visualization, a dataset manager and editor, and an easy-to-use library of machine learning models. We use a block-based code editor to reduce the barrier of entry as much as we can and to make it possible to focus on what your project is doing, not syntax or complicated constructs like classes.

We've also developed a community site, allowing users to share their projects with the world and fork other peoples' projects. Being able to see other people's projects and experiment with them makes learning ML a lot more exciting, makes the concepts less abstract and gives learners motivation.

We've been doing all development publicly on GitHub because we value open source software, find the development model advantageous, and want to give back (what's the point of keeping the source private?). We're now at the point where we're ready to release Kobra to the world, but we'll keep making it better (we have a lot of features in the works).

To summarize, machine learning is already a cornerstone of modern technology and its role in society will only increase. We're on a mission to remove as many unnecessary barriers of entry from the path to learn it as we can, and Kobra is how we're doing that.
